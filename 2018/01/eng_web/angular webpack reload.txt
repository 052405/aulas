I faced with the same problem on Ubuntu 16.04 and angular CLI 1.0.0-beta.30

The problem was related with Inotify Watches Limit on Linux.
To solve to issue I increased the watches limit to 512K

sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
sudo sysctl -p --system

After that I restarted my IDE (WebStorm in my case) and after that the change detection started to work.
